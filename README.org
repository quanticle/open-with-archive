#+TITLE: Open With Archive.today

This is a small Firefox extension that adds a context menu item to links which opens the archive.today version of the links. It uses the new =timegate= feature of archive.today, and passes the URL without query params to archive.today, and opens the archive page in a new tab. By default this extension uses =archive.is=, but the specific archive.today mirror can be configured in the preference page.
